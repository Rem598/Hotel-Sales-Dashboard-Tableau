## 📋 Project Overview

This project involves the analysis and visualization of daily food sales data from a local hotel spanning an eight-month period (September 2024 to April 2025).

The dashboard was specifically designed to address these core business objectives:
1.  **Revenue Generation:** Analyze which of the 12 food items contribute most to total revenue.
2.  **Trend Analysis:** Identify consistent weekly and seasonal sales trends (e.g., specific days or holidays).
3.  **Optimization:** Use demand patterns (lunch vs. dinner) to recommend stock and pricing adjustments.

## 🔍 Key Findings & Insights

The visualization and analysis revealed distinct patterns crucial for operational planning:

* **Consistent Bestsellers:** **Tea** and **Chapati** are reliably the top-selling items every week, indicating they are staple products that should always be prioritized in inventory and preparation.
* **Demand Window:** Items like **Ugali Matumbo** and **Chapati Ndengu** show significantly **stronger demand during lunch hours** but weaken considerably in the evening, suggesting a time-based menu approach.
* **Off-Peak Predictability:** Sales exhibit a reliable and consistent **dip on Sundays and public holidays**, signaling a predictable reduction in demand for low-demand stock.

## 📈 Recommendations

Based on the data and visualizations, the following strategies are recommended to increase profitability and reduce waste:

1.  **Increase Morning Value:** Introduce **bundle deals** (e.g., Tea + Chapati) during early morning hours to increase the average transaction value of the bestselling items.
2.  **Promote Lunch Combos:** Implement a **lunch loyalty program** specifically targeting popular combination meals like the ugali combos to capitalize on the confirmed midday demand spike.
3.  **Optimize Sunday Inventory:** Drastically **reduce perishable stock and low-demand items on Saturdays** in preparation for Sunday, minimizing waste during the predicted sales dip.
